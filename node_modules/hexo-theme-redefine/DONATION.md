**非常感谢各位对本项目的支持！！**  
**Thank you very much for your support to this project!**

## 引言 / Introduction

刚开始这个主题其实是自用的，后来有网友看见我的博客，就问我是怎么改的。  
Initially, this theme was created for my personal use, but later, some readers came across my blog and asked me how I customized it.

想了一下，就开了个项目。一路走来，跌跌撞撞也写了几个版本，也收到了不少网友的反馈，而且第一次拿到这么多 Star，在这里非常感谢各位的支持。  
After giving it some thought, I decided to start a project. Along the way, I encountered some challenges and went through several versions. I also received valuable feedback from many users. Moreover, it's the first time I've received such a high number of stars. I want to express my sincere appreciation for all your support.

本来没想着要求打赏，但是目前阿里云国内下行流量平均一个月消耗 100GB，本人每月流量费用大概在 20 元左右，想着换 unpkg/jsdelivr 做 cdn，但是那个速度真的感人。  
Originally, I hadn't planned on requesting any contributions. However, currently, the average monthly consumption of downstream traffic on Aliyun in China is around 100GB, and my monthly traffic cost is approximately 20 yuan. I considered switching to unpkg/jsdelivr as a CDN, but the speed there is truly disappointing.

如果各位能支持一下，**一块两块都已足够**，就能维持阿里云 CDN 的流量费用，本人实在是感激不尽。  
If any of you could provide some support, even a small amount such as one or two yuan, it would be sufficient to cover the CDN traffic cost on Aliyun. I would be immensely grateful for your assistance.

感谢所有赞助本项目的朋友，你们的支持是我继续更新的动力！  
Thank you to all the friends who have sponsored this project. Your support is what motivates me to keep updating and improving it!
