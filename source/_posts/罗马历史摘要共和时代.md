# 罗马历史摘要共和时代

- 共和时代从公元前509年开始，当时罗马人废除了“王政”，改行共和制度，结束了王权时期，开始了近500年的罗马共和国时期。
- 共和时代早期，罗马政权掌握在元老院、公民大会以及执政官、监察官等行政长官手中，逐步形成寡头共和政体。
- 从公元前3世纪中叶起，罗马共和国开始向海外扩张。通过布匿战争、马其顿战争和叙利亚战争，罗马人确立了在地中海地区的霸权。
- 共和时代后期，罗马社会出现了严重的贫富差距和阶级矛盾。贵族占有大量的土地和奴隶，而平民和自耕农失去了生活保障。士兵也不再忠于国家，而是依附于个人将领。
- 为了改革社会不平等，格拉古兄弟提出了分配土地给穷人的方案，但遭到贵族的反对和暗杀。马略则推行了募兵制，使大批无地或少地公民涌入军队。
- 共和时代末期，罗马陷入了长期的内战。先后出现了前三头同盟（克拉苏、凯撒、庞培）、后三头同盟（安东尼、雷必达、屋大维）等军事集团。屋大维最终击败了所有的对手，成为事实上的独裁者。
- 公元前27年，元老院授予屋大维“奥古斯都”的尊号，建立元首制。屋大维大权在握成为第一位皇帝，罗马共和国结束了，古罗马进入了帝国时代。

# Summary of Roman History in the Republican Era

- The republican era began in 509 BC, when the Romans abolished the "monarchy" and adopted the republican system, ending the monarchical period and starting the nearly 500-year period of the Roman Republic.
- In the early republican era, the Roman power was held by the Senate, the Assembly of Citizens, and executive magistrates such as consuls and censors, gradually forming an oligarchic republic.
- From the mid-3rd century BC, the Roman Republic began to expand overseas. Through the Punic Wars, the Macedonian Wars and the Syrian Wars, the Romans established their hegemony in the Mediterranean region.
- In the late republican era, Roman society faced serious wealth gap and class conflict. The nobles owned large amounts of land and slaves, while the commoners and small farmers lost their livelihood. The soldiers also became loyal to individual generals rather than to the state.
- To reform social inequality, the Gracchi brothers proposed a plan to distribute land to the poor, but were opposed and assassinated by the nobles. Marius implemented a recruitment system that allowed a large number of landless or poor citizens to join the army.
- At the end of the republican era, Rome fell into a long civil war. There were military groups such as the First Triumvirate (Crassus, Caesar, Pompey) and the Second Triumvirate (Antony, Lepidus, Octavian
